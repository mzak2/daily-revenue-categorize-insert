OVERVIEW:
A Excel based file that utilizes built in VBA programming and scripting to Analyze/ Categorize the type of information contained within the two CSV files. This process would normally
require 4 labor hours of combing through data, pulling reports, and then inserting it correctly into each account tab. This Project is currently in use and saves roughly 4 hours of time
daily from actual workers at this company.
